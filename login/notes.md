# Notes
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server.
- Implement CSRF (cross-site request forgery) protection using tokens.
- Limit the number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Store sensitive information — such as database credentials — in a separate configuration file outside the web server’s document root.
- Regularly update your software, including PHP, MySQL, and your web server, to apply the latest security patches.
